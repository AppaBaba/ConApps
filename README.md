# ConApps
TUI
This is about installing the console tools and applications for develoment of
Text User Interface (TUI) and there will be no Graphical User Interface (GUI)
I will start by showing how to install these tools and apps on Windows Subsystem
for Linux (wsl). Ther will also be stuff on Windows console, Beaglebone Black,
Raspberry Pi, and maybe even some games, like the ones that you would see on
an 8 bit BBS.
